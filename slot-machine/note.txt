Another way to style our component is by embed css directly of it. 
e.g.,

      <label
        style={{fontSize: '2em', color: 'hsla(208, 100%, 97%, 0.714)'}}
        className="result" htmlFor="textInput">
        {winner ? 'You Win!' : 'You Loose!'} 
      </label>

  Note that:
   *Style has double breakers {{}}
   *Instead of writing class we use camelCase in React and the correct way to
      declare it is =>  className
   *Same situation above happens with attributes that use kebab-case this they
      must be written with cameCase as well.
      e.g., font-size  = fontSize
   *The value we give for each attribute must be written inside '' or ""
   *Each attribute with its value, must be separated by comas.
